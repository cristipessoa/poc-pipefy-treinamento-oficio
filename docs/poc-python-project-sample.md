With a more advanced application, youâ€™ll want to maintain good documentation of all
its parts. I like to put any documentation for internal modules here, which is why 
you see separate documents for the hello and world packages.
If you use docstrings in your internal modules (and you should!), 
your whole-module documentation should at the very least give a holistic 
view of the purpose and function of the module.
